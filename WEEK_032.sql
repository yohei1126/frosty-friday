-- This week weâ€™re looking into some new security features that Snowflake has recently released
-- As you might know, the default idle time for Snowflake sessions is 4 hours BUT that was recently
-- adjusted; you can now change this value on certain levels.
-- Because we can finetune these numbers, Management has asked us to enforce it for some of our new
-- colleagues :
-- The challenge for this week:
-- Create 2 users
-- User 1 should have a max idle time of 8 minutes in the old Snowflake UI
-- User 2 should have a max idle time of 10 minutes in SnowSQL and in their communication with Snowflake
-- from tools like Tableau

-- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/session-policies-using
-- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-session-policy
-- SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINS -- For Snowflake clients and programmatic clients, the number of minutes in which a session can be idle before users must authenticate to Snowflake again. If a value is not specified, Snowflake uses the default value.
-- SESSION_UI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINS -- For Snowsight, the number of minutes in which a session can be idle before a user must authenticate to Snowflake again. If a value is not specified, Snowflake uses the default value.
