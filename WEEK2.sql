-- A stakeholder in the HR department wants to do some change-tracking but is concerned
-- that the stream which was created for them gives them too much info they donâ€™t care about.
-- Load in the parquet data and transform it into a table, then create a stream that will
-- only show us changes to the dept and job_title columns. 
-- You can find the parquet data here.

-- Execute the following commands:
-- update <table_name> set country = 'Japan' where employee_id = 8;
-- update <table_name> set last_name = 'Forester' where employee_id = 22;
-- update <table_name> set dept = 'Marketing' where employee_id = 25;
-- update <table_name> set title = 'Ms' where employee_id = 32;
-- update <table_name> set job_title = 'Senior Financial Analyst' where employee_id = 68;
